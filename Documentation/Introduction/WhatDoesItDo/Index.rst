Betatext does allow users to comment any part of a text. The comments can be rated up and down.
Users may request to be marked as “verified” to show that they represent officially an
institution, use their real name or are especially trusted. 

Betatext is used for collaborating work; One can leave constructive criticism towards specific words
and phrases in a text and what may be added or changed before the final version of the document is
printed.

To visualise the state of the text, you can add a display of steps involved, describing what happens
next, e.g. “first draft”, “gathering public opinion”, “second draft”, “publication”.

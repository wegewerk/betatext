============

For an detailed installation guide, please refer to the tutorial section.

After installation of the extension, you have to set the extension configuration correctly, the page
type of the page you want to comment on needs to be set to “betatext” and “commentable text”
needs to be checked.

If you deactivate “commentable text” again, already made comments will still be visible.

To add a Betatext process step, add new record at the list view of the page aptly named “betatext:
process step”. Please refer to the tutorial section on how you need to edit the template. 

This extension does not <text:bookmark text:name="result_box3"/>control the registration of front
end users – you have to use another extension.

The API documentation is available at the `github wiki
<https://github.com/wegewerk/betatext/wiki/API-Overview>`__ .
